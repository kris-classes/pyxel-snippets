"""
Simple autoreloader which can probably break in a million ways.

NOTE: Requires the module being run to define an App() class.
Useful for prototyping small pyxel apps or experimenting with snippets.

Usage:
    python autoreload.py my_pyxel_file.py


Or if you're on Linux/MacOS, chmod+x then ./autoreload.py myfile.py
You can also add it to your PATH as a script called 'autoreload' if you like.

Currently only supports 1 file and the file must have a class named App.
Wrote this in ~30 minutes (after ~15 years of using Python) so it's probably
full of bugs and ways it can fail.
